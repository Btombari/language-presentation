### <tt><small><small>part.0</small></small></tt> Collaboration
The assignment is hosted at https://github.com/jmazzare/language-presentation. In the previous assignment, you created your own fork of the repo. For this assignment, you have been added as a collaborator to this repo. You will pull, edit, merge, and push this to this repo.

There are two parts to the workflow:

1. Initial checkout of the repository
2. Committing your changes

### <tt><small><small>part.1</small></small></tt> Language Demonstration

Each of you have been assigned a topic in your chosen language. You can find your name and topic in `LANGUAGES.md`. 

### <tt><small><small>part.2</small></small></tt> Presentation
