### <tt><small><small>part.0</small></small></tt> Collaboration
The assignment is hosted at https://github.com/jmazzare/language-presentation. In the previous assignment, you created your own fork of the repo. For this assignment, you have been added as a collaborator to this repo. You will pull, edit, merge, and push this to this repo.

There are two parts to the workflow:

1. Initial checkout of the repository
2. Committing your changes

Do not fork this repository, you have read/write access. Clone it into your working directory. After you've done your editing, be sure to merge any changes added by others since you've last updated. As long as you keep your edits to your section in the file, there shouldn't be merge conflicts. 

__Do not use the github editor, edit from onyx or your own machine__

Sooner than later, add a line to the `LANGUAGES.md` file in your section, pull, merge if needed, commit and push back to _this_ repository. I may not be able to help you troubleshoot this process at the last minute.

### <tt><small><small>part.1</small></small></tt> Language Demonstration

Each of you have been assigned a topic in your chosen language. You can find your name and topic in `LANGUAGES.md`. 

In your section __of that file__, add your content. Also include code samples that demonstrate the feature you are showcasing.

Here are some questions regarding your feature that can help get you started:
- What is the syntax of the feature? The semantics?
- How does it work, what are the rules?
- How and when is this feature used?
- Are there any best practices? What are they?
- What are common mistakes when using this feature?

As you did for the previous assignment, research your feature and write an article about it. If you are studying the same language, you can use your previous assignment as a starting point. If you have switched languages (or even if you haven't), you can also use the submissions from the previous assignment as a starting point. You must add your own content and additional information as well, of course.

You can put your code samples directly into the file by enclosing the code in triple-back-ticks.

A Perl example of embedded code with syntax highlighting:
```perl
use strict;

sub parg {
    my($a, $b, $c) = @_;

    print "A: $a $b $c\n";
    print "B: $#_ [@_]\n\n";
}

parg("Hi", "there", "fred");
```

You should cover the topic in depth enough that you can present about it.

### <tt><small><small>part.2</small></small></tt> Presentation

Be prepared to present your work and explain your code to the class. You will present alone. Your presentation should last 3-4 minutes.

Here are some ideas of what you can present:
- An explanation/walk-through of your code
- Languages features you enjoyed, didn't enjoy
- Areas you had to troubleshoot
- A feature/technique that you learned
- Specific information regarding your language topic
