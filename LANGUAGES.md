A "JOIN" in SQL is a keyword which tells the system to perform set like operations on two or more tables and returns a new set of rows and columns. This is one of the fundamental features of the database management system's "relational" capabilities. Each table can store data unique to itself and then "relate" this data to other tables containing shared data points. 

For example, if a Product table has related category information, a separate Category table is created with all possible categories and a unique identifier for each (the key column or columns). Then, the Product table is joined to the Categories table by the key to allow for the selection of category information not contained in the Products table. The Products table only needs to store the key for the category that it relates to, not all of the category information. The key column could simply be the name column, which would be its natural key, but many systems use a surrogate key, such as an integer and create an id column which uniquely identifies the record. Using the id key, tables can be related to each other by a single column rather than multiple columns, making the join much easier.

Multiple joins can be included in one statement, so any combination of tables is allowed, including joining a table to itself. A predicate, or boolean comparison, specifies which fields (columns) to match between the two tables. Multiple predicates can be specified in a single join using AND or OR. Other selection criteria are specified using the "WHERE" clause. In ANSI-standard SQL there are five types of joins: Inner Join, Left Outer Join, Right Outer Join, Full Outer Join and Cross Join.

The basic syntax for a join operation is something like this: 
```
SELECT [table_name].[column_name], [table_name].[column_name] AS alias, [table_name].*, ...
FROM left_table AS alias
JOIN (right_table, right_table2, ...)
ON (predicate AND/OR predicate)
WHERE predicate AND/OR predicate AND/OR IN (SELECT ...) AND/OR Other operators ...
ORDER BY [table_name].[column_name], ...
```
Standard comparison operators (=, <, <=, >, >=, != or <>) can be used in the predicate when comparing column values.

##### INNER JOIN or JOIN
The intersection of the two tables based on the join predicate that indicates which columns to compare. Only elements that match the join-predicate in both tables are included in the result set. This is the default behavior for a join.
```
SELECT Departments.department, Categories.category, Products.name, Products.description
FROM Departments
JOIN Categories ON Departments.department_id = Categories.department_id
JOIN Products ON Categories.category_id = Products.category_id AND/OR ... [Another predicate]
WHERE Departments.department_id = 10
```

##### OUTER JOINS
Outer joins are joins in which there does not need to be a matching predicate in both tables. There are three basic flavors.

**LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN**
The LEFT JOIN includes all records from the "left" table and only those that match the predicate in the "right" table. If there are no matching records in the LEFT table, then NULL is returned for the match. 

The following example selects all rows in the Departments (LEFT) table and only records in the Categories table that match the predicate.
```
SELECT *
FROM Departments
LEFT JOIN Categories ON Departments.department_id = Categories.department_id
WHERE Categories.id IS NULL --This gets only departments that have no related categories.
```

**RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN**
The RIGHT JOIN includes all records from the "right" table and only those that match the predicate in the "left" table. This is identical to the LEFT JOIN, except reversed.

The following example selects all rows in the Categories (RIGHT) table and only records in the Departments table that match the predicate.
```
SELECT *
FROM Departments
RIGHT JOIN Categories ON Categories.department_id = Departments.department_id --Order of tables in the predicate does not matter.
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN**
The union of the two tables based on the predicate. All elements from both tables are included in the result set, whether they match the predicate or not. This is effectively the same as combining the LEFT and RIGHT outer joins.
```
SELECT *
FROM Departments
FULL JOIN Categories ON Departments.department_id = Categories.department_id
```

##### CROSS JOIN (CARTESIAN PRODUCT)
Takes every element from a table and combines it with every element of another table. If the first table contains 4 rows and the second contains 10 rows, the result will be 40 rows. No predicate is specified in this type of join. A WHERE clause can be used to filter the results. Obviously, this is a dangerous query to run on large tables.
```
SELECT *
FROM Departments
CROSS JOIN Categories
```
This is the same as:
```
SELECT *
FROM Departments, Categories
```

##### Self Join
Joins are allowed between a table and itself. This feature can be used where a relation exists within the same table. An example of this might be a category table that has sub-categories. Instead of having two separate category tables, a single table can be used with each Category record specifying a "parent" category id in the same table.

Example:
[category_id], [name], [description], [parent_category_id]

```
SELECT Categories.*, SubCategories.* 
FROM Categories
JOIN Categories as SubCategories ON Categories.category_id = SubCategories.parent_category_id
```

##### Conclusion
SQL is a simple but powerful language for working with relational database systems. The basics are very easy to learn and very powerful. The syntax of the language is also very easy to understand. For any company that shares data between systems, an RDBMS will probably be used and SQL will be used for retrieving, updating, and storing data. It is essential to have experience with SQL!
